this repository is a compendium of my solutions to the exercises from the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

all the source is written in Scheme (Lisp). I used the MIT/GNU Scheme to follow this book. Latest versions of the compiler can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/).
